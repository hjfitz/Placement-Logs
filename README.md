## Additional Information
During my time at Eli Lilly and Co, I was a full stack JavaScript developer. I wrote Node.js for server-side software and JavaScript (with heavy use of React) on the front-end. I was a member of Cirrus Labs, which was a part of the larger Cirrus team.

Within Cirrus Labs, there were 5 of us - all on placement. We followed an [Agile Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) methodology. Our sprints generally lasted 2 weeks.

## Projects
During the placement, I took on a number of projects. Either shared with the developers, or my own personal projects. The shared projects are referred to 'the current sprint'
