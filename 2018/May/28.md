# Week Beginning May 21, 2018

## Work Carried Out
* LillyDev Documentation
* Contentful Prep and Presentation

### LillyDev Documentation
This was my second week on documentation. I spent a lot of time here improving a wiki on the project - more specifically on the code that I'd written. This was my core role this week.

Much earlier on in this sprint, I asked the team to use a tool known as JSDoc. We commented our code properly throughout the sprint, and we've now saved an ungodly amount of time in documentation!

### Contentful Prep
I spent a large amount of time preparing for my talk at Contentful, refining the slides for the presentation on Thursday where we would travel up to London and give the talk.

The talk went down fantastically! We got a load of questions, some goodies from Contentful. They even took us out for a pint after!
