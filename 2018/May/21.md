### Contentful
The main focus of this week was to refine and practise the contentful presentation: I was to present it to them on Thursday.

As monday was a bank holiday, all of tuesday was spent perfecting the slides, and practising them. In order to get a good amount of practise in, I booked an impromptu Lunch & Learn on Tuesday.

Wednesday morning was spent practising, too. I then presented to the UK IT student body, as well as a couple of member of staff. this presentation was well recieved from everybody, with a little feedback to improve upon. After some more improvement and practise, we presented it to the people at Contentful. This was something that we had to do before we would be allowed.

We presented to Contentful together, and the presentation was well recieved by them, with some great critical feedback! Friday was spent addressing this.
