# Week Beginning March 5, 2018

## Work Carried Out
* 6 Month Challenge Run-Through
* Picking up dashboard for core work

### 6MC Run Through
This week started with a practise session for our 6 month presentation. We were doing this because when we initially presented the 6MC, we weren't recorded! Because of this, We had to go again as a group. I attented a practise session in the morning, and framed our re-recording as a Lunch & Learn - so that whoever missed it can attend again.

### Dashboard & Core Work
Tuesday consisted of a handover session: I was picking up a Dashbaord from where another developer left off. We spent a lot of time going over the code and how the dashboard should look. After this, I moved all of the stories on the kanboard to my name and worked on the dashboard for the rest of the week.

## Competences
* D2 - handover session
* C3 - allocate different parts of dashboard to other developer
* D1 - 6MC as a L&L
