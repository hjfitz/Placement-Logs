# Week Beginning June 4, 2018

## Work Carried Out
This was a pretty hectic week this week. It started off with phil being OOO, so we had to have a sprint review without the scrum master. After this, I started work on fixing the tools that are used for continuous integration throughout Lilly. This is what I spent the vast majority of my week on.

I also had time this week to catch up with the smart people at contentful for a bit of feedback on the talk that I gave last week. It sounds like the talk went really well, and a number of people found it interesting! This will hopefully be on youtube in the coming weeks!

I had a meeting with one of the architects in the new 'developer factory' in india. This was to go over the premise of PWAs the the react.js package that I'd build - just so that he could better understand things like client-side routing.

Finally this week, I had my 12 month challenge. This went really well, given that I was randomly put in to a group of 7 people given a problem statement and had to come up with a solution + presentation in less than 5 hours! I was with a group of very driven people, who all did their part!
