## Work Carried Out
* Bootcamp practise
* 6MC meetups
* 6MC Education
* Core work

### Bootcamp
My IT Bootcamp is next week. There are a number of presentations for it; I'm running 3, and the team have between 1-2 each. With all presentations, a lot of practise is required. It means that I can give some feedback to them, and vice-versa. There were a couple of practise sessions a day - so that I could fit 2 weeks worth of presentations in to a week, and have time for improved sessions.

### 6 Month Challenge
This was, in my opinion, a slow week for a challenge that seemed so daunting. The team I was in was placed with a challenge from the research center - in other words, this was a difficult challenge. There were a couple of meetups, but not a lot of progress was made.

Thankfully, another member of the team gave a presentation on some technology that he was working with. This was ideal: it gave me a base to start working with. It gave my team hope! Shortly after this, another member of the group found that she had a contact, who works with technologies like this. This would be a great place to start the research in!

The remainder of my time this week was spent on my core role, with some aid to another developer who wanted to learn how a library we used worked in more detail.
