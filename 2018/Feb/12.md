### 6 Month Challenge
The beginning of the week was spent practising and preparing for our presentation. 

When it came to the day of the challenge, I helped set the table up for the group, as well as driving traffic to our stand. This was very important to me because I was going to be presenting with my group at the same time as another group - and I wanted the larger crowd.

I was finally happy with the amount of people showing interest before I had my time to present. The room was packed, which was ideal for the audience participation piece that I had planned.
