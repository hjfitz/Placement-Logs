# Week Beginning February 26, 2018

## Work Carried Out
* BI Accelerator meetings
* BIA dev
* core sprint

### BI Accelerator
This week was spent partially around the BI Accelerator. It was almost ready for an MVP, which was fantastic timing: another business unit within the organisation was looking in to create something very similar. Because of this, I booked some time with them to see if I could help them out, and where our paths crossed.

Ultimately, this meeting proved to be very promising! We had another meeting later on this week to talk about the technology in more detail.

Other than BI Accelerator work, my time this week was around core sprint
