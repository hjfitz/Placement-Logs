# Week Beginning February 19, 2018

## Work Carried Out
* core work
* BI Accelerator coding

### BI Accelerator
Dotted throughout the week were little sessions to begin coding the BI Accelerator - a one-click website for the business intergrator. This would allow them to spin up a professional looking website, wherein they could add their own content. This would make the time it takes for an integrator to build a website go from 60 days to 10 minutes.

I opted to pair program this, so that my coleague Phil could learn more about the technologies that we were going to be using. This would enable us to better market it.

The remainder of my time this week was spent on core work.
