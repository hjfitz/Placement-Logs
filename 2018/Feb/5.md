# Week Beginning February 5, 2018

## Work Carried Out
* last bootcamp session
* 6ma practise
* core sprint

### Bootcamp
The first day of the week was the last session for the IT Bootcamp. It was awkward timing, but I had to make do because of the trip to Erl Wood last week. 

I was presenting this session, with a very difficult, technical challenge. This time was spent trying to firsly find a secret key from a server endpoint, and POST this as well as a name to a different endpoint on a server. Whoever did this got their place on the hall of fame. 1/5th of the students in attendance managed this!

### 6MC Practise
The vast majority of this week was spend preparing for the 6 Month Challenge. Every morning was spent either refining the presentation or practising it in lieu of next week.

The remainder of my time was spent on the current sprint.
