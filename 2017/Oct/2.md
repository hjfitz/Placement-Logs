# Week Beginning October 2, 2017

## Work Carried Out
* DHC
* Pi Project
* Contentful meeting
* Core work

###Â Pi Project
this week started off with some great time dedicated to developing the raspberry pi project. I started off my morning before I left for work by soldering some parts to a circuit board. when I got in, I started writing some code for it to ensure that it worked! the plan is to create a dashboard for all of the peripherals that I've build in to the raspberry pi

### DHC
I worked a bit on the student recruitment website. This is because of the sweeping changes coming to the student programmer: there is no more developer role! It's a sad time - seeing as I'm a developer.

I managed to get the site done in the morning, right before one of the university presentations!

### Contentful Meeting
I'm still struggling with the caching system on the core project. I met with the developers at Contentful to make sure that I'm actually using the platform as intended - I'm not. I need to go back to this part of the project and ensure that it's following their best guidelines.

The remainder of this week was spent coding, and fixing the caching layer. This is my core role.
