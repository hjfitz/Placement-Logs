# Week Beginning October 23, 2017

## Work Carried Out
* Awards app
* Meetings about Bootcamp
* Crash course on react
* Core work

### Awards app
Some of my coding this week was done on a different platform - Salesforce. It wasn't the typical node.js. It was a java-esque language. I was adding some more code to an internal awards app!

### Bootcamp
This week was new to me: I was meeting with a number of people about the bootcamp idea that I came up with last week. I met with a technical architect and the lead of engagement for our BU. They were very useful, and gave great, valuable insight in to the sort of content, types of teaching and how to market it to the wider Lilly audience.

### Crash Course
I gave a crash course on React.js this week to a couple of less-than-technical students. This involved giving them some boilerplate code that I'd built (setting up the toolchain for this takes a while), and getting them to go off of that. I gave them a couple of tasks, like hitting an API and setting state of a component.

Although this was well-recieved, I felt as thought I needed more than 90 minutes. The issue is getting time out of their calendars as it's not core work. If I'm going to help out in future, this might have to be out of hours.

The remainder of this week was spent working on LillyDev.
