# Week Beginning October 9, 2017

## Work Carried Out
* worked on pi project
* updated auth module
* caching layer fixes
* service worker talk

### Pi Project
This week, I got a lot of good work on the raspberry pi project done. I finally managed to create a dashboard for the peripherals. This was following an interesting microservice architecture: there was a node.js server to hold and serve the main js files. To interact with the peripherals, I created a server in python, which the frontend code could interact with via websockets. I'm very proud of this little setup!

### Auth Module
I finally got around to unverstanding and maintaining the module that I'd inherited. I managed to do a whole load of maintenance on it - moving from old JS callback functions to promises and async/await!

Taking feedback in mind from other developers, I removed a bunch of configuraion variables. This meant that the setup for the module was minimal.

### Caching layer fixes
As part of my core role this week, I set to remove the redis cache. This was causing some massive issues in LillyDev: Everytime some new data was added, the server had to restart to reindex. This wasn't ideal.

Page responses are a little slower, but it's more maintainable. This is a tradeoff that I'm happy to make.

###Â Talk
I also gave a talk to my peers on Service Workers, and how they can turn a SPA in to a PWA. This went down really well with them, and I'm looking to add a worker to LillyDev!
