# Week Beginning October 16, 2017

## Work Carried Out
* meeting for bootcamp
* begin automation work
* meet up about pi project
* core work

### Bootcamp
I had a 1:1 with another student in my dev squad. We coined the idea of an IT Bootcamp - a two week course on web development. I thought that this could have a great impact on the student, and higher-level-staff-body! Because of this, I'm going to meet with Phil more and more about it - and hopefully get something up and running! I'd love to teach this because it would significantly improve my presentation skills, and help out the wider staff audience.

### Automation
This week was the kick-off for automation work. As part of my core role, I set out to automate some tasks that could otherwise be difficult to do manually - such as clear out hundreds of users from the github organisation.

###Â Pi Project
I finally got to show off my hardwork this week. I met with the sponsor of the Pi project, and showed him what I'd made! He loved it. I'm not sure where to go after this - not much more development is required.
