# Week Beginning Nov 6, 2017

## Work Carried Out
* Bootcamp 
* Core Work
* Mini hackathon

### Bootcamp
I had more time to work on the bootcamp this week! Firstly, I managed to meet with the lead of the Student IT Program to explain the idea, and hopefully get her backing. I wanted to know if i'd be able to run it and have a number of IT Students appear every day. I didn't want to interrupt their work. After explaining what the premise of the bootcamp was, she was absolutely on board! I had her backing, which meant that I could lay more of the groundwork for it - and meet with people that are higher-up.

One thing that did come up was people asking questions: there will be some technically confident students, and some not. This means that the less technical students might be a bit apprehensive to ask a question. For this, I spent some of the week building a basic websocket-based chat - with anonyminity in mind.

### Mini Hackathon
I also met with the Student Recruitment Lead this week. This was to discuss recruiting technical Systems Analysts in to my business unit. To do this, he wanted share his ideas for a hackathon. This was done with a programmable robot. The robot could be programmed in JavaScript which was ideal - it's the language we use.

We were given the bots to play with in the meantime!

The majority of my time was spent programming LillyDev as part of the core sprint.
