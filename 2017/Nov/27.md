# Week Beginning Nov 27, 2017

## Work Carried Out
* Module blueprint
* Core work

### Module Blueprint
This week was spent on a small project. I was preparing a blueprint for module development within my team. I met with another developer, and we took all of the good things from our modules, and put them in to the blueprint. I'm sure that this will change in future.

---

Because the only other thing I did this week was the module blueprint, I spent most of my time working on the core sprint. This included fixes to service workers, and the caching system that was build. I decided to rip it all out, and start again, with a far simpler method of caching individual API responses over everything that's stored in the API. The new way of caching was fantastically simple - and abused ES6 Promises:

```js
function cache(key, cb) {
  return new Promise(res => {
    getDataFromCache(key).then(resp => {
      if (resp.found) {
        res(resp.data);
        return cb().then(data => storeInCache(key, data));
      }
      cb().then(data => {
        res(data)
        storeInCache(key, data);
      });
    });
  });
}
```

## Competences
* A2 - chose different great aspects from different internal modules to work on module blueprint
* A2 - used learnings from lazy cache to improve lillydev
* B1 - added caching back to lillydev after attempting to find a much simpler solution
