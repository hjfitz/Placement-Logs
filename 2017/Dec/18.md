# Week Beginning December 18, 2018

## Work Carried Out
* IT Bootcamp L&L
* Core Role

### Core Role
Thankfully, this week was significantly quieter than last. The vast majority of my time this week was spent programming!

### IT Bootcamp
The week kicked off with some final practise. I didn't feel too confident with this because the slides kept changing, and I didn't have a lot of time to practise.

Fortunately, at midday on Monday, I presented my L&L (as well as Phil), and it went down fantastically! I got a load of questions, which was a good sign. When the presentation was over, I felt significantly more confident with presenting to crowds of people!

I got a lot of good feedback for this presentation, even from the Chief of Staff within my BU.

## Competences
* A1/C1 - Core role programming LillyDev
* D1 - IT Bootcamp L&L
