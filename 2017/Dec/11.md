# Week Beginning December 11, 2018

## Work Carried Out
* SARs
* Feedback
* Insights
* L&L Prep

### SARs
This week deviated a little bit from my core role. A lot of 'admin' esque things had to be done. This week started off with my preparing my SARs. These are pieces of text that all of us students have to do to let our managers know what we've been up to for our first 6 months. I also thing that they will be very helpful for future job applications.

### Feedback
Another admin-y thing that I had to do this week was prepare some feedback for both my manager and technical coach. This took up a larger chunk of time than I'd expected.

### Insights
A whole day was booked out for this. I'd previously completed an online questionnaire for this day - it was a personality test of sorts. Everybody (all IT Students) that took this had their results that day. We were given different percentage levels of how we acted; I had a very high critical-thinking level and low levels of extraversion. Typical for a Computer Science student.

This day was spent understanding who got which result, and how to approach different people with different personality types.

### L&L Prep
Friday this week was spent preparing for a L&L that I'd booked a while back: An Intro to the IT Bootcamp. This is next Monday, and I didn't get a lot of time to prepare for this.

The remainder of my time this week was spent on my core sprint/role.
