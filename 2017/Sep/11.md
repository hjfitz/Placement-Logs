## Work Carried Out
Today was a generic day. Today i worked on getting a large pull request through. I also met with my technical coach regarding the current sprint, as the deadline is this friday, and gave him an update on where we were with the project.

I also updated the team for the raspberry project on my progress through the development - as well asking for some more defined deadlines.

Today was very much a continuation of the sprint, especially as the deadline for this project is this thursday. Today primarily involved me writing code to ensure that the navigation of the website was not only working, but was working on the design of the navbar. After meeting with the team, product owner and technical coach, we agreed that the design was good, and implemented it in to the current development branch.

It was also the day that I got enough time to work properly on the code for my raspberry pi side-project. After getting the very basic readout from the sensors and formatting it nicely, I emailed the rest of the team involved in it - setting up a meeting later on today to go over what works and what needs to be improved.

When the time for the meeting rolled around, the product owner came, had a look and took some pictures to show the director. He was very happy. We discussed how the data should be formatted, and deadlines for the project.

Today, we were greeted by our technical coach to, who spent the rest of the previous day testing the program, lodging a total of 20 bugs on our issue tracker. He gave us a rundown of the most important bugs to squash, as well as ways that we can avoid these - testing in different browsers and actual phones, rather than the responsive view.

We spend the entire day (mostly) fixing these and updating the issue tracker. I held a meeting iwth the team to ensure that we had a proper protocol to follow before accepting pull requests, as well as cleaning up our issue tracker - we hadn't closed issues after fixing them.

With a protocol put in place, we were able to properly scrutinize eachother's code thereon.

Today was a continuation of the sprint. For this, I had a task set at a complexity of '8' which means that it will take a number of days to get completed. The morning was spent on this.

As the afternoon came along, I got a bit of time to spend on side projects. I focused primarily on the Raspberry Pi project, as this has a shorted deadline. I was able to get the operating system for the raspberry pi set up, ready for some development. There is an issue though - the corporate WiFi networks don't work with the raspberry pi, so I had to set up a bluetooth tether between my work laptop and pi to get it online. Whilst I was doing this, I was able to explain to my teammate how this was done, and how we could access the hardware ports for our development.

Today was a day with more stress than normal. We had to ensure that the project was ready to our Chief of Staff, Manager and Technical Coach - laying large responsibility on my navigation/generation component for the project. With 15 minutes to spare, I had polished the project to a standard that I was happy enough to show them.

We gave a short, 30 minute presentation showcasing everything that we had done, taking turns in speaking about our involvement in the project, and showing the things that we have done.

It appeared that we had impressed out chief of staff as we were awarded a bonus!

After the presentation, we went on to plan the rest of the sprint, with what feedback we did receive.

At the end of the day, I met with my technical coach to go over another one of my assigned side projects - a node module for authentication. This provides both authorisation and authentication for the entire company. In this meeting, we went over a roadmap for the future of the project and set some tasks for me to complete, in a set deadline.
