## Work Carried Out
Today was a generic day. Today i worked on getting a large pull request through. I also met with my technical coach regarding the current sprint, as the deadline is this Friday, and gave him an update on where we were with the project.

I also updated the team for the raspberry project on my progress through the development - as well asking for some more defined deadlines.

## Work Carried Out
Today was very much a continuation of the sprint, especially as the deadline for this project is this Thursday. Today primarily involved me writing code to ensure that the navigation of the website was not only working, but was working on the design of the navigation bar. After meeting with the team, product owner and technical coach, we agreed that the design was good, and implemented it in to the current development branch.

It was also the day that I got enough time to work properly on the code for my raspberry pi side-project. After getting the very basic readout from the sensors and formatting it nicely, I emailed the rest of the team involved in it - setting up a meeting later on today to go over what works and what needs to be improved.

When the time for the meeting rolled around, the product owner came, had a look and took some pictures to show the director. He was very happy. We discussed how the data should be formatted, and deadlines for the project.

Today, we were greeted by our technical coach to, who spent the rest of the previous day testing the program, lodging a total of 20 bugs on our issue tracker. He gave us a rundown of the most important bugs to squash, as well as ways that we can avoid these - testing in different browsers and actual phones, rather than the responsive view.

We spend the entire day (mostly) fixing these and updating the issue tracker. I held a meeting iwth the team to ensure that we had a proper protocol to follow before accepting pull requests, as well as cleaning up our issue tracker - we hadn't closed issues after fixing them.

With a protocol put in place, we were able to properly scrutinize each-other's code thereon.

## Work Carried Out
Today was a fairly ordinary work day. I started off the day by working on the current sprint - with a larger focus on bug fixing, as tomorrow is the deadline. It's the end of the day now, and at this point, there are a minuscule few more bugs to iron out - which means that we're right on track.

The afternoon was something different though. I met with my technical _mentor_ over Skype (he is based in Indiana). We met for a catch up on one of my side-projects. The project that I am working on is one with very high visibility. It's an awards app for the entire IT part of the organisation - and I'm working on adding some new features to ensure that this project can be maintained through the years. This time with my mentor was spent learning some vital skills for using force.com - the platform in which this project is built. We went over important concepts such as the sandbox (an area in which I can make changes without them being reflected online) as well as setting up my development environment.

It's deadline day, and everything is looking fantastic on the website - which is very good. We've got a student curriculum event. A scavenger event that was set in London.

This soon changed after we got wind of some bad news.

The scavenger hunt was relocated to Winchester.

For this day, we were split in to teams and given a map of places to visit. Once we got to the places, we were meant to take a picture of the group. These were used to create a video for the group meal at the end of the day. This and a few other factors were used to judge who had won the day!

The main point of this student curriculum day was to get to know other students from other departments, and learn to work well with other people. Having come second to the top in the scoreboard, I feel as though this was a very successful day. I also feel as though that it was successful as I had made some new friends/connections and got on well with everyone.
