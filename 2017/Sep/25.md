# Week Beginning 25 September, 2017

## Work Carried Out
* Student Curriculum

### Core Work
Thankfully, this was a *very* quiet week. A lot of it was spent programming in my current sprint.

As well as programming, one of the members of my BU was leaving for America for 6 months. He's my technical coach, and I'll miss having him around.

### Student Curriculum
As well as programming this week, I spent some time in student curriculum sessions, learning about networking and how our performance is monitored.

## Competences
* D1 - learn about networking
* C1 - spend most of my time working on lillydev
