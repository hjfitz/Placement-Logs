## Work Carried Out
After two days off, I was kindly greeted back in the morning standup, with the team. They had made good progress since I'd left - meaning that I was able to get a kick-start on what I was meant to be doing. I managed to get a much-anticipated pull request. After this, I was able to start pair-programming with the technical SME in the project. This enabled me to get a greater understanding of hte underlying project.

After this, the day was devoted to side projects. I got the requirements for a organisation-wide awards website that I have started to help maintain. For this, I had an hour conference call with the product owner, who briefed me on the requirements, and showed me how to set up an IDE, for salesforce.

After a meeting with the product owner for one side project, I met with me teammate for another side-project - building some hardware with the raspberry pi. During this, I showed the teammate how to set up their new laptop for development, and showed them how to develop using git and feature branches.
