## Work Carried Out
After two days off, I was kindly greeted back in the morning standup, with the team. They had made good progress since I'd left - meaning that I was able to get a kick-start on what I was meant to be doing. I managed to get a much-anticipated pull request. After this, I was able to start pair-programming with the technical SME in the project. This enabled me to get a greater understanding of hte underlying project.

After this, the day was devoted to side projects. I got the requirements for a organisation-wide awards website that I have started to help maintain. For this, I had an hour conference call with the product owner, who briefed me on the requirements, and showed me how to set up an IDE, for salesforce.

After a meeting with the product owner for one side project, I met with me teammate for another side-project - building some hardware with the raspberry pi. During this, I showed the teammate how to set up their new laptop for development, and showed them how to develop using git and feature branches.

Today was a continuation of the sprint. For this, I had a task set at a complexity of '8' which means that it will take a number of days to get completed. The morning was spent on this.

As the afternoon came along, I got a bit of time to spend on side projects. I focused primarily on the Raspberry Pi project, as this has a shorted deadline. I was able to get the operating system for the raspberry pi set up, ready for some development. There is an issue though - the corporate WiFi networks don't work with the raspberry pi, so I had to set up a bluetooth tether between my work laptop and pi to get it online. Whilst I was doing this, I was able to explain to my teammate how this was done, and how we could access the hardware ports for our development.

Today was a day with more stress than normal. We had to ensure that the project was ready to our Chief of Staff, Manager and Technical Coach - laying large responsibility on my navigation/generation component for the project. With 15 minutes to spare, I had polished the project to a standard that I was happy enough to show them.

We gave a short, 30 minute presentation showcasing everything that we had done, taking turns in speaking about our involvement in the project, and showing the things that we have done.

It appeared that we had impressed out chief of staff as we were awarded a bonus!

After the presentation, we went on to plan the rest of the sprint, with what feedback we did receive.

At the end of the day, I met with my technical coach to go over another one of my assigned side projects - a node module for authentication. This provides both authorisation and authentication for the entire company. In this meeting, we went over a roadmap for the future of the project and set some tasks for me to complete, in a set deadline.
