# Week Beginning 17 July, 2017

## Work Carried Out
* I was able to get stuck in to the code a lot more this week - last week I'd taken part in poker planning. Because of this, I could start writing front-end components for LillyDev!
* Because of the nature of the team, I attended a few online meetings - meetings using Skype. These were to meet with the product owner, and show him where I was with the project. This was also an opportunity to learn from him, and build out the project to his specifications: he was showing off some wireframes suring some of these meetings
* Some more learning was done this week - this time on VCS. I learnt a great deal about github and how the organisation used this. This was the last talk that one of the previous students gave us - it was his last day.
* I was also being pushed to perform a Lunch and Learn (L&L). This is a lunch-time talk wherein anybody can give a talk about anything. Because the team I'm in (Cirrus Labs) is a little different, the talk was to be done on this. I met with the rest of the team (all students) to plan this).

## Competences
* A1/C1 - work on and improve frontend components for lillydev with more js knowledge that I'd been picking up on the job
* D1 - communicate on online meeting
