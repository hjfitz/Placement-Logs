# Week Beginning 24 July, 2017

## Work Carried Out
* This was a quiet week. I was straight in to my role of developing code. I loved this week, less learning and more coding. One caveat to this is that I've got a 5 year old Macbook Pro to develop on. The experience is fine, but I have to transpile Javascript when I develop here. This is a pain on this laptop because each compilation takes up to 30s! The other 3 developers only have a 5s wait. I think I'll look in to updating the webpack configuration file in future, and seeing if I can add anything to it to enhance performance.
* As well as writing code this week, I had a number of planning sessions with the team. Our L&L was this Friday, and we were all nervous. Every day, toward the end of the day, we'd book out a conference room and plan/dry-run this talk.
* Friday came around, and we were the first of the new students to give a L&L. this went down really well, with a great turnout!
