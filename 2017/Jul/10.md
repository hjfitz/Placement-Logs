# Week Beginning 10 July, 2017

## Work Carried Out
* A lot of this week was still spent learning. There was handover for usability tseting, intro to the site I'd be helping build and an intro to personal projects - things we'd have handed over to us.
  * I would be taking on a project called the auth module. This is a node.js module that appends single sign-on to any node.js application!
* I participated in a thing called 'poker planning' this week. this is where we go in to a room and essentially vote on how long a story would take. It's a pretty cool way of working out how much time everything takes, and giving everybody equal amounts of work for a 'sprint'.

---
My downtime this week was spent learning how a tool called 'webpack' works. This is because the project I'd be helping build, LillyDev, used it.

It's a complicated tool, but it essentially allows you to transpile and bundle javascript files together, so that they work on any browser - and there's no `<script>` tags.

## Competences
* D2 - liase with other members of lilly during handover
* A1 - Applied ICT principles to learn how to use webpack
* D1 - Poker planning allowed me to use technical and non-technical terms when planning for the sprint
