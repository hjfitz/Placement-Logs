# Week Beginning 31 July, 2017

## Work Carried Out
* This was another very quiet week; a lot of the time I had was spent developing. I've been thrown in to a pretty big, complicated project. It's not some jquery/php project - it's fullstack node.js+react.js! This is a great stack, and I'm loving it more and more. The issue is just that there's so much to learn. Thankfully, I've had enough time this week to get the code I need to write done, as well as learn about the new stuff in this project.
* As well as plain development work, there was another poker planning session. My first sprint on LillyDev was done. In this session, I showed off what I'd done as part of this team sprint, and planned for the next features.
