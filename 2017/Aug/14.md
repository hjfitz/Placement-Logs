# Week Beginning 14 August, 2017

## Work Carried Out
* This week consisted of two main things.
* Firstly, I spent a lot of time working on the new sprint in LillyDev. I finished one of my frontend components last week, but moved on to something a little bit more complicated this week: a navigation bar. this is something that had to be dynamically generated based off of the different entries in the content management system that powers this website.
* As well as developing LillyDev (otherwise known as LPLD), I attended an agile bootcamp. This was a 3 day intensive course that aimed to teach me and the team how to follow an agile methodology when I code and plan for future 'sprints'.
