# Week Beginning 07 August, 2017

## Work Carried Out
* This week was a little busier than normal.
* Firstly, I spent a lot of time coding - not just on LillyDev, but I've mentioned in previous entries that I'd inherited a node.js module - A lot of this week was dedicated to learning how it works (because there was no documentation on it), and then attempting to fix a bug wherein the module would loop, and a given user couldn't login.
* There was also a sprint retrospective this week, which the team and myself joined. This was a fantastic opportunity for us to speak about what went well, badly and what could be improved on with regards to the previous sprint.
* I also managed to pick up a new project this week - a project where I could build some hardware with a raspberry pi! I can't go in to a lot of detail, but I'll be writing software and creating some hardware!
