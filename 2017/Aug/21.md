## Work Carried Out
Met with people from other department to start work on new side project. Issue arose with ordering incorrect component. Consolidated and worked towards solution for side project.

Spent time helping out co-worker with some broken code - fixed ready for testing.

Showed teammate from side-project basic Git setup, for use later on down the line.
